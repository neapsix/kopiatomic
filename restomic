VERSION='0.2'

# Paths for FreeBSD:
ZFS='/sbin/zfs'
GREP='/usr/bin/grep'
RESTIC='/usr/local/bin/restic'

# Paths for Linux:
# Note: Linux is not currently supported due to use of nullfs
# ZFS='/usr/sbin/zfs'
# GREP='/usr/bin/grep'
# RESTIC='/usr/bin/restic'

# Snapshot namespace is a prefix (script name and PID) and the date
PREFIX="$(basename $0)_$$_"
DATE=$(date "+%F_%T")
TMPDIR="/tmp/.$PREFIX$DATE"
MNTDIR="/restic"

__usage="
Usage: $(basename $0) [-h][-n][-N][-r][-a][-v] <dataset or mountpoint> [...]
"

__help="
Makes atomic backups with restic by creating a snapshot of each zfs dataset,
nullfs-mounting those snapshots together into a temp directory, and running the
backup command on the contents of that directory.

The script backs up the zfs datasets or dataset mountpoints you specify.
Datasets must be mounted to be backed up. You can optionally process child
datasets with -r or process all mounted datasets with -a.

Because it uses nullfs to assemble filesystems, the script runs only on 
FreeBSD.

For example, $(basename $0) -r zroot, given the following zfs list output:

        \$ zfs list -t filesystem -H -o name
        zroot
        zroot/usr
        zroot/usr/home

creates snapshots using a prefix, PID, and date as namespace, such as:

        zroot@${PREFIX}${DATE}
        zroot/usr@${PREFIX}${DATE}
        zroot/usr/home@${PREFIX}${DATE}

Then, for each dataset, it (1) gets the mountpoint as follows:

        \$ zfs get -H -o value mountpoint zroot/usr/home
        /usr/home

If there is a mountpoint, it (2) mounts the snapshot contents as follows:

        # mount -o ro -t nullfs \\
            /usr/home/.zfs/snapshot/${PREFIX}${DATE} \\
            ${MNTDIR}/usr/home

and runs a restic backup command as follows:

        # restic backup ${MNTDIR}

Finally, it unmounts the nullfs directory tree, removes the temp directory,
and destroys the snapshots that were created.

Options:
        -a      Back up all datasets
        -c      Specify command to run (default: \`restic backup\`)
        -h      Print this help text and exit
        -n      Dry run without actually creating snapshots or backing up
        -p      Specify arguments to pass to the command
        -r      Process children of specified datasets recursively
        -v      Print the version number and exit

# mount_snapshots()
#
# For each dataset, open the snapshot and mount it into a directory tree.
#
# First, ensures the directory for a temp file to record exists. Then, loops 
# over zfs datasets from the args (either a string or blank for all). For each
# one, generates and runs commands to do the following:
#
#   1. Look up the dataset mountpoint, skipping datasets with no mountpoint.
#   2. Mount the snapshot's mountpoint (/dataset/.zfs/snapshot/<name>) within
#      the working directory, recreating the mounted filesystem layout,
#      skipping datasets for which the snapshot mountpoint doesn't exist.
#   3. Write out the mount desgination to the temp file.
#
# For example, for dataset zroot/usr/home:
#   
#   # zfs get -H -o value mountpoint zroot/usr/home
#   # mount -o ro -t nullfs \
#       /usr/home/.zfs/snapshot/restomic_123_2022-01-14_01:00:00 \
#       /restic/usr/home
#   # printf /restic/usr/home >> /tmp/
